Ahoy, fellow voyager of the decentralized seas! As we set sail on this grand quest to onboard a billion souls to the realm of Web3, I couldn't agree more with your astute observation – a journey of such magnitude demands not just brute force but a tactical approach. To navigate this uncharted territory, we must turn our gaze upon the beacon of blockchain technology, which illuminates two distinct and exclusive use-cases: identity and liquidity.

Identity, the very essence of individuality, takes center stage as one of the prime beneficiaries of blockchain's prowess. With the cryptographic magic at its core, blockchain bestows upon us the power to forge a secure, immutable, and transparent identity system. Farewell to the days of tangled bureaucratic webs and labyrinthine identity verifications! Blockchain emerges as a lighthouse of truth, allowing each soul to claim their digital sovereignty with undeniable authenticity.

But let us not forget, fellow explorer, that with great power comes great responsibility. As we traverse the treacherous seas of digital identity, we must ensure that the sanctity of privacy remains intact. Just as Jekyll and Hyde grappled with their dual identities, we, too, must find the right balance between transparency and confidentiality in the realm of Web3.

Now, let us turn our telescope to the second celestial body that beckons us – liquidity! Ah, the sweet nectar of tradability and exchange, made even sweeter by the blockchain's transformative touch. Gone are the days when markets were walled gardens of the privileged few. Blockchain breathes life into a borderless realm of assets, where tokens flow freely like verses of Shakespeare's sonnets.

Yet, as Shakespeare himself wisely quipped, "All the world's a stage," and so, too, is the blockchain market. We must be wary of the temptations that arise, for not all tokens are created equal. Discernment and due diligence shall be our compass, steering us away from the sirens of empty promises and pump-and-dump schemes.

As we stand at the precipice of the billion-user abyss, let us remember that our voyage requires more than just fanciful dreams. It demands a pragmatic approach, an understanding that onboarding is not an end in itself but rather a means to a greater end – enabling use-cases that only blockchain can birth.
